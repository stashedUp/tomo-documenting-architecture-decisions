# fargate-comparison.py

This script is meant to help compare the costs of existing EC2 backed ECS clusters with expected costs in Fargate.

It will create an Excel spreadsheet that shows the on-demand based costs, but also allows a user to modify fields to explore "what if" scenarios.

The script is pretty rough at the moment, but additions/cleanups are more than welcome!
